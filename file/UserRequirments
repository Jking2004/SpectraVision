User Requirements (Based on Project Brief) 
•	Take Good Pictures:
•	Capture clear, detailed pictures.
•	Work well in different lighting (bright, dim, etc.).
•	Recognize Objects:
•	Accurately identify specific things (products, people).
•	Learn to recognize new things over time.
•	Make sure the camera is good at recognizing simple objects.
•	Find and name objects in the picture in real-time.
•	Send Alerts:
•	Let users set up alerts for certain objects or events.
•	Send alerts in different ways (email, text, app).
•	Manage Data:
•	Work with existing data systems (if any are used).
•	Make it easy to find and use the data.
•	Send data to a central computer (server) using MQTT for later use.
•	Be Easy to Use:
•	Have a simple interface for setting up and watching the camera.
•	Show detected objects and alerts clearly.
•	Use a dashboard to display the information to the user
•	Allow Remote Access:
•	Let users see the camera feed and data from anywhere.
•	Allow users to change camera settings remotely.
•	Do Specific Tasks:
•	Smart Alarm: See if it's possible to use the camera as a smart alarm.
•	People Counter: Count how many people go into a place.
•	Water Monitoring: Watch for water being dumped into rivers.
•	Sewer Monitoring: Watch a sewer valve remotely.
•	Monitor Water Companies: to monitor the times and durations that they discharge any untreated sewage into the river network.
•	Use the Right Model:
•	Validate the performance of the camera for simple object recognition. This will include some academic content in the field of machine learning and computer vision.
•	Consider YOLO for recognizing objects.
•	Label Data:
•	Use tools like LabelImg to label the images and draw boxes around the objects of interest.
